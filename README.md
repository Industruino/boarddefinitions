# Board definitions for 1286
Board definition files for the 1286 version of the Industruino top board

Industruino comes with 2 different microcontrollers:
* 32u4: a standard Arduino of the 'Leonardo' type so you do not need to install any board definition files; in the Arduino IDE go to Tools > Boards and select 'Arduino Leonardo'
* 1286: a non-standard Arduino microcontroller that requires the installation of specific board definition files into your Arduino IDE
